# AntiSurfaceCamping
AntiSurfaceCamping is a SCP:SL plugin that uses the EXILED framework to deter players from surface camping.
It does this be inflecting damage to a player after a certain amount of time on the surface.

- Configurable damage dealt to players
- Configurable messages
- Configurable time before damage starts

I am open to pull requests!
