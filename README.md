# AntiSurfaceCamping
AntiSurfaceCamping is a SCP:SL plugin that uses the EXILED framework to deter players from surface camping.
It does this be inflecting damage to a player after a certain amount of time in the surface zone.

- Configurable damage dealt to players
- Configurable messages
- Configurable time before damage starts
- Many more features coming soon

I am open to pull and feature requests!
